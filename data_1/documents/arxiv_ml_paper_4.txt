Title: Scalable Signature Kernel Computations for Long Time Series via Local Neumann Series Expansions

Abstract:
The signature kernel is a recent state-of-the-art tool for analyzing
high-dimensional sequential data, valued for its theoretical guarantees and
strong empirical performance. In this paper, we present a novel method for
efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time
series via dynamically truncated recursive local power series expansions.
Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a
Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive
rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are
locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire
domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series.
Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent local Goursat
PDEs by recursively propagating boundary conditions along a directed graph via
topological ordering, with dynamic truncation adaptively terminating each local
power series expansion when coefficients fall below machine precision, striking
an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy. This method
achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches
for computing the signature kernel, providing (a) adjustable and superior
accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically
reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very
long time series (e.g., with up to half a million points or more) on a single
GPU. These advantages make our method particularly well-suited for
rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing
applications that involve very long and highly volatile data.
